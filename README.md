# ExoPlanet-Dataset-Project
I downloaded the ExoPlanet Dataset from Kaggle and performed Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Data Visualizations on it. 
The objective was to test my knowledge and command over different Python libraries related to data science including scikit-learn, pandas and matplotlib,

Part 1
•	Histogram of data based on the classes e.g 
•	Attributes correlation
  Highly correlated (Scatter plots).
•	Dissimilarity Index (with in same class)
  Highlighted outliers in scatter plots. (e.g. Yes or No)
•	Apply analysis (PCA and LDA).

Part 2
For Classification:
•	Feature Selection/Reduction/Extraction.
•	Preprocessing.
•	Model Selection (KNN, Min Dist., Bayesian, D.T, SVM, Ensemble [any 4]).
•	Performance (Sensitivity, Precision, ROC curve, Confusion Matrix).
